    <h2>Description</h2>

    <br><br>

    My  motivation for this project was simplify the css for the Horiseon website in order to achieve long-term sustainability for the web-developers working on it.
    
    <br><br>
    
    I built this project in order to show how the code behind a website can produce a visible pleasing outcome for a user viewing the webpage, but still not be structured well (ie. unorgaized, repetitive) from the perspective of someone viewing the code behind it.
    
    <br><br>

    The main problem I solved was the accesibility and structure of the html and css. The html lacked semantic tags, using div tags instead. The images also did not have any alternative descriptions. There were too many classes being used that all had the same styling that coud easily be simplified by creating just a few classes to style more elements on the webpage. Another problem I came across was that one of the links was not functioning because it was missing an identifer in the html file. 
    
    <br><br>

    I learned that there are many ways to code and still achieve the same output on a webpage, although that is not enough to produce quality work. The average user viewing the website won't notice anything if you change the classes in your css for example, however, a web developer working on the website would have a much easier time viewing the code and make changes to it if it's well simplified, defined, and structured.
